Title: Pushing the boundaries of population genomic computation with the tree sequence

Abstract: 
Computer simulations of evolving populations are a crucial tool for
exploration, inference, and validation with population genomic data.  However,
due to the size of the genome, simulation of large, sexual populations -
especially across geography - has been a major challenge.  I will discuss how
efforts to make these simulations feasible has led to development of a new data
structure, the succinct tree sequence, that stores genetic variation data
orders of magnitude more efficiently as usual methods, while at the same time
encoding the entire genealogical history of every genome. I will also describe
what simulations are possible today, and some applications.
